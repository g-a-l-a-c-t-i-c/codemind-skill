# Working against an existing codebase

## existingFiles

Pass `existingFiles: [{path, content, role?}]` on `build_feature` to
patch specific files instead of generating a whole new codebase.

- `role: "target"` — forces this path to become its own patchable
  component, even if your `acceptanceCriteria` doesn't name it
  explicitly. Use this specifically when a prior failed build's result
  named the path under `unmatchedExistingFiles` — that means Codemind
  saw the file but didn't treat it as something to patch.
- `role: "context"` — this file is supplied only to resolve some
  *other* file's import, not to be patched itself. It exempts this
  file's own imports from the sibling-import check below — unless your
  `acceptanceCriteria` quotes this exact path verbatim, in which case
  it's treated like a normal entry and the exemption doesn't apply.
- Omitted `role` — **not** the same as `context`: this file's own
  relative imports are always required to be supplied, identically to
  `target`. `role` only adds a signal about whether Codemind treats
  the path as a guaranteed component; it never removes the import
  requirement.
- **A test-file path (`*.test.ts`, `*_test.go`, `test_*.py`, `*Test.kt`,
  etc.) cannot be an `existingFiles` entry at all** — Codemind always
  synthesizes its own verification test per component, so submitting
  one is rejected outright, regardless of `role`.

## The sibling-import check

Before submission, Codemind scans every relative import (`./x`, `../x`,
Python `from .x import`) inside your non-`context` `existingFiles`
entries. If an import's target isn't also in `existingFiles`, the call
is rejected with a message telling you which file to add (or to mark
the importing file `role: "context"` if it's not actually a component
you want built). This only applies to import-syntax stacks (TS/JS,
Python) — Swift/Kotlin have no equivalent check.

## projectId

Pass the same `projectId` across multiple `build_feature` calls against
the same codebase (combined with `existingFiles`) to get codebase-context
enrichment, and every build automatically reindexes its own output for
the next call. Use this for "keep iterating on the same project," not
one-off builds.

`existingFiles` and `skipTestsFor` both work the same way per-item
inside `build_batch` — but neither is a `build_feature`-only feature
either way, since `projectId` is NOT available on `build_batch` items;
batch items don't get this cross-call codebase-context enrichment,
only a single `build_feature` call does. `build_from_spec`'s
LLM-decomposed stories are more limited still: they carry only
`{repoUrl, storyTitle, acceptanceCriteria, stackType}` — no
`existingFiles`/`skipTestsFor` field exists on that path at all, since
the decomposer has no access to real file content. Reviewing with
`dryRun: true` and resubmitting via `build_batch` directly is how you
add `existingFiles`/`skipTestsFor` to a spec-decomposed story.

## skipTestsFor

`skipTestsFor: ["path/one.ts", "path/two.ts"]` — up to 20 repo-relative
paths where Codemind should not author test code. You own the
unverified-code risk for those specific files. Other files in the same
build still get normal test coverage, and if *every* component in the
build ends up test-skipped, the build still fails loudly (Codemind
refuses to ship a build with zero test signal).

**This only filters which test files get delivered to you — automated
verification still always runs against every component regardless.**
If the target project has no test infrastructure at all, expect the
build to fail even with every file listed here — there's currently no
fallback verification mode (e.g. typecheck-only) for a project with
nothing to run tests through. `skipTestsFor` solves "I don't want a
scaffolded test file I'll never use," not "this project has no way to
run tests."

## Private registries — not supported for standalone builds

There is no `npmrc` param — standalone `build_feature` builds have no
dependency-install step on any backend to authenticate. A component
that imports a private package will fail QA. Private-registry auth
exists only for Cloud Repo Mode's own repo-attachment path, which this
Skill doesn't cover.
